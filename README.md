# wecycle-react-app
Project for Hack The Valley 4, held in Toronto Canada

React Native App developed with the help of Expo.

This was my first time using React Native, I picked it up and started using it over the course of the hackathon.
I worked on this project as the Frontend Developer and spent 12 hours coding this out so it's a little rough around the edges.

Uses the Camera function to capture an image that is sent to a Node.js backend which forwards the data to a Google AutoML instance 
hosted on Google Cloud.

This project is to be paired with 2 other repositories in the GaJuBeaTed organisation, which is my teammates for the Hackathon.
