# wecycle-react-app
Project for Hack The Valley 4, held in Toronto Canada
This is a mobile application developed using React Native, it allows the user to capture an image which is sent to a Node.js backend, which forwards the data to a Google AutoML instance hosted on Google Cloud. It also has a leaderboard to track the score. I've always been a treehugger and try find ways to use tech to make the world a better place.

React Native App developed with the help of Expo. My first time using React Native, I picked it up and developed this app over the course of 12 hours so it's a little rough around the edges.

This project is to be paired with 2 other repositories in the GaJuBeaTed organisation.
